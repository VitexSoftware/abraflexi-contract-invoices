# Copilot Instructions

All files in the multiflexi/*.app.json directory must conform to the schema available at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VitexSoftware/php-vitexsoftware-multiflexi-core/refs/heads/main/multiflexi.app.schema.json

After every single edit to a PHP file, always run `php -l` on the edited file to lint it and ensure code sanity before proceeding further. This is mandatory for all PHP code changes.
